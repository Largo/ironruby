# Fetches the launch video's music: Edvard Grieg, "In the Hall of the Mountain King"
# (Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, Op. 46, IV), played by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra
# for Musopen, from classicals.de. The recording is in the public domain, marked
# CC PDM 1.0 (https://www.classicals.de/grieg-peer-gynt), so it may be used in the video
# without conditions; the release notes credit it all the same.
#
#   media/launch/tools/fetch-music.sh            # -> media/launch/assets/music/mountain-king.mp3
#   media/launch/tools/fetch-music.sh --profile  # and print its loudness every half second
#
# The repository does not carry the recording: the render fetches it, and the checksum
# pins the exact file, so a different download cannot slip into a release unnoticed.
# --profile is how the cuts in index.html were placed (data-media-start) without
# listening: it prints the momentary loudness (EBU R128, LUFS) over time.
