# ARGF - the files named on the command line read as though they were one
# stream, or standard input when there are none.  CRuby implements it in C
# (argf.c); this is the same object built on File and IO.
#
# Two pieces of state carry most of the behaviour:
#
#   @current   the IO being read.  It is *kept* after it has been read to the
#              end and closed, because ARGF.file and ARGF.filename go on
#              answering for the file that was read last.
#   @spent     the current file has nothing more to give, so the next read has
#              to move on.  Separate from @current.closed? because the file is
#              only closed when it is left behind.
#
# ARGV is consumed as files are opened - ARGF.argv is the same array, and what
# it holds is what is still to come.
