# MRI's ext/objspace. Its work is heap walking and a per-object allocation record, neither of
# which the CLR offers, so:
#
# * dump(obj) describes the object it is given faithfully - type, class, size, value, what it
#   references - but the addresses are #object_id values, not real addresses, and MRI's
#   heap-internal fields (shape_id, slot_size, flags) are left out.
# * dump_all and memsize_of_all walk what ObjectSpace knows of instead of the heap: every module
#   and class, plus the strings, arrays, hashes and Ruby objects created since this file was
#   required - requiring it switches that recording on (see ObjectSpace.__track_objects__), which
#   is the one cost the library imposes, and nothing is recorded before it. Objects of other types
#   (a Proc, a Range, a CLR object) are not recorded at all.
# * memsize_of estimates the managed size: one object header plus the payload. It is meant for
#   comparing objects of the same kind, not for adding up a heap.
# * trace_object_allocations records the allocation site of the same four kinds of object, taken
#   from the TracePoint :line hook of the statement that allocated (so the file and line are the
#   statement's, and allocations inside a method of the core library written in Ruby - which has
#   no :line events, as it stands for C code - are reported at the caller's statement). The
#   class path and method id are those of the allocating method, nil in a block or at the top
#   level, as in MRI.
