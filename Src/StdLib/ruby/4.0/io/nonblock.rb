# io/nonblock - the O_NONBLOCK descriptor flag.
#
# Where the stream has an operating system descriptor this asks the kernel, so
# it gives the right answer for a descriptor nobody here opened. Not every
# stream has one: IronRuby's IO.pipe is not backed by a FileStream, so
# IO#GetNativeDescriptor answers -1 for a pipe and there is no flag to read. For
# those the value is remembered instead, which is a weaker answer.
#
# A pipe answers what it was last told: MRI opens its pipes non-blocking, so
# until #nonblock= says otherwise one reports true, though its descriptor here
# was opened blocking - IO's own reads and writes wait either way. Setting the
# flag still sets it on the descriptor, which is what #syswrite goes by.
