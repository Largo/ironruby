/* ****************************************************************************
 *
 * A Stream over a raw file descriptor, for the two things FileStream cannot do.
 *
 * FileStream tracks a position of its own and writes with pwrite(2) whenever it
 * believes the handle is seekable. Two of them over descriptors that share one
 * open file description - which is exactly what a child's standard output and
 * standard error are once both have been redirected to the same file - then each
 * write at their own offset and overwrite each other, where CRuby's sequential
 * writes append.
 *
 * And a read FileStream has started cannot be interrupted: closing the IO from
 * another thread, which Ruby defines as making the blocked read raise IOError,
 * leaves the reader parked in read(2) for ever. Waiting in poll(2) with a short
 * timeout and re-checking a flag gives the reader somewhere to notice from.
