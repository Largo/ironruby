    // whenever a method change there could alter what a *cached* lookup would find - but only for
    // lookups that registered themselves the way a call site does, since IronRuby bumps lazily:
    //  - a found method is marked InvalidateSitesOnOverride, so overriding, undefining, removing,
    //    hiding or re-visibility-ing it (anywhere below its owner, including via include/extend)
    //    bumps the version;
    //  - an absent name goes into RubyContext.MissingMethodsCachedInSites, so a later definition
    //    of that name in any class, or in any module mixed into one, bumps it.
    // Prepend, refine, extension methods and TracePoint bump unconditionally. Registering exactly
    // as call sites do means the cache is sound for precisely the reason cached rules are.

    // A fill takes the class-hierarchy lock, reads the version, resolves and publishes under that
    // one lock hold; versions only change under the same lock, so an entry can never be filed under
    // a version it was not computed at. A reader that races a concurrent definition sees either the
    // state before it or falls through to the lock - the same guarantee a call site's version check
    // gives. Only classes are cached: a module's VersionHandle is never bumped (only the classes
    // that depend on it are), so a module's lookups keep taking the lock.
