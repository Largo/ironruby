    /// (a Volatile.Write is a release, a Volatile.Read an acquire, an Interlocked operation a full
    /// fence; plain accesses promise nothing more - in particular a plain store followed by a
    /// plain load of another location may be reordered, even on x64):

    /// * Read. s = _ivars; shape = Volatile.Read(s[0]); value = s[i]. The acquire on s[0] orders
    ///   the slot read after it, so a reader that sees a shape published by an add also sees the
    ///   value the add stored before publishing it.
    ///
    /// * Write of an existing variable. s[i] = v, then re-read s[0]; if it is no longer the shape
    ///   the write was made for, redo the write the slow way. Never loses a write - see Move.

    ///   change on their re-read (a harmless redo). Anyone who sees Busy spins: the window is two
    ///   stores long.
    ///
    /// * Move: growing past the capacity, removing a variable, going "too complex". Done under
    ///   lock(this), so movers are serialized. CAS s[0] from S to
    ///   <see cref="InstanceVariableShape.Moved"/>, then
    ///   <see cref="Interlocked.MemoryBarrierProcessWide"/>, then copy the slots into the new
    ///   array and publish it with a release write of _ivars. The old array is dead from then on
    ///   - its element 0 stays Moved - and anyone who meets Moved waits for the lock and reloads.
    ///   A writer that stored into the old array without a fence of its own is not lost: the
    ///   process-wide barrier runs a full fence on every thread, so for each writer either its
    ///   store is globally visible before the copy (and copied), or its re-read of s[0] comes
    ///   after the barrier and sees Moved (and it redoes the write into the new array). This is
    ///   the asymmetric Dekker pattern: the rare side (a move) pays for the fence so that the hot
    ///   side (every ivar write) does not. A move of an array with no slots needs none of that -
    ///   nobody can be writing into it (it may be the shared EmptySlots) - and is a CAS on _ivars.
