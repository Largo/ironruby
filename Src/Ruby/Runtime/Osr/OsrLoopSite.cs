/* ****************************************************************************
 *
 * -X:OSR - on-stack replacement for Ruby loops.
 *
 * The DLR tiers up per *invocation*: a LightLambda compiles itself after ~32 calls. A hot
 * loop inside a body that is entered once therefore stays interpreted forever, which is the
 * shape a Ruby script's main loop has - and the shape of every loop in Util/bench.
 *
 * What makes replacing such a loop cheap here is where IronRuby keeps Ruby locals: in one
 * MutableTuple per scope, which the RubyScope points at. They are not in the frame, so there
 * is no frame state to materialize. A loop can be abandoned at a back edge, its tuples
 * handed to a compiled copy, and the copy started at the top of the next iteration.
 *
 * What is worth replacing it *with* is the other half of the story. Handing the loop's own
 * expression tree to the DLR's compiler buys almost nothing - measured on Util/bench,
 * IronRuby's compiled tier runs an arithmetic loop at the same speed as its interpreter,
 * because the cost is the dynamic call site on every `+' and every `<', not the
 * interpretation. So the copy this asks for is a *type-specialized* one (JitLoopCompiler),
 * with the loop's locals in CLR int/double locals and a Fixnum add compiled to an add. That
 * is worth 3-7x, and when the loop is not the shape that can have one, the site retires and
 * the loop runs exactly as it did before.
 *
 * The counter itself lives in the loop, in a CLR local, and costs two compares and a
 * decrement per iteration. The site's Countdown field is only read on the way in and written
 * on the way out, so a loop entered many times for a few iterations each still adds up.
