# The most popular gems on rubygems.org, under IronRuby

How far down rubygems.org's own most-downloaded list IronRuby gets, and what
stops it where it stops.

## Method

The list is rubygems.org/stats, which publishes the top 100 by all-time
downloads, ten to a page. 77 of those 100 are in the popular tier of
`Util/gems/catalog.rb` and are measured here. The other 23 are accounted for at
the bottom of this file; none of them is left out because it failed.

Every gem is installed from rubygems.org with IronRuby's own RubyGems:

```sh
export GEM_HOME="$PWD/.gems"      # never the shared user gem dir
Util/gems/install-popular.sh
Util/gems/run.sh popular
```

For each gem the harness requires it, and then:

* runs the gem's own test suite, if the `.gem` ships one. Almost none do - a
  `.gem` is the shipped library, not the repository - so this is rare;
* otherwise runs `Util/gems/exercises/<gem>.rb`, a small but real use of the
  gem, under **both IronRuby and CRuby 4.0.6**, and diffs stdout. CRuby is the
  oracle and byte-identical output is the pass.

The exercises are not smoke tests. They boot a Rails application and serve it a
request, run ActiveRecord against a real in-memory database, render an ERB
template through ActionView, sign an AWS request and parse a stubbed response,
run `rubocop --format emacs` over a file with a real offence and compare the
report, drive a Pry session from a string, build a PNG and decode it again,
fetch over a loopback WEBrick. `Util/gems/exercises/README.md` says what an
exercise has to do to count.

A gem that only loads is reported as "load only", which is not a pass, and the
table says so.

## Status

WORKS means the exercise (or the gem's own suite) produced byte-identical
output to CRuby 4.0.6. The rank is the gem's position in the top-100 list.

| 64 | nio4r | 2.7.5 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension: an epoll/kqueue selector. A .NET shim is plausible - see below |
| 65 | http-cookie | 1.1.6 | **WORKS** | a cookie jar: parsing Set-Cookie, domain and path matching, `HttpOnly`, expiry |
| 66 | rails-dom-testing | 2.3.0 | load only | exercised through actionpack |
| 67 | domain_name | 0.6.20260907 | **WORKS** | registrable domain, cookie-domain rules, IDN, superdomains |
| 68 | regexp_parser | 2.13.0 | **WORKS** | parses and walks a pattern with groups, quantifiers and alternation; scanner and lexer |
| 69 | globalid | 1.4.0 | **WORKS** | GID round trip, `Locator`, parsing. Signed GIDs are not exercised: they need a `JSON.parse` arity the oracle's json gem refuses |
| 70 | websocket-driver | 0.8.2 | **BROKEN** | C extension (the mask loop). The gem will not install without it, although its Ruby is written to run without the `.so` |
| 71 | coderay | 1.1.3 | **WORKS** | scans Ruby, JSON and SQL; token streams, HTML and terminal encoders. Needed the nested-character-class fix |
| 72 | pry | 0.16.0 | **WORKS** | a real REPL session driven from a string: evaluation, `show-source`, `cd`/`_`, and `Pry::Method` |
| 73 | erubi | 1.13.1 | **WORKS** | compiles and evaluates templates, escaping, trim mode, custom bufvar |

| 77 | mini_portile2 | 2.8.9 | load only | a build helper for C extensions; there is nothing else to ask of it here |
| 78 | thread_safe | 0.3.6 | load only | a deprecated shim over concurrent-ruby |
| 79 | puma | 8.0.2 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension: the HTTP parser and the IO reactor |
| 81 | multi_xml | 0.9.1 | **WORKS** | parses a document with attributes, typed values and nested elements; `ParseError`. Needed the `REXML::Attributes#each_attribute` enumerator fix |
| 82 | websocket-extensions | 0.1.5 | **WORKS** | the extension negotiation protocol with a hand-written extension, plus the header parser |
| 83 | redis | 6.0.0 | **WORKS** (no server) | URL and config parsing, the error hierarchy, and a connection attempt that fails as `Redis::CannotConnectError`. There is no redis-server here to talk to |
| 84 | rubocop-ast | 1.50.0 | **WORKS** | node traversal, `NodePattern` matching, tokens, method and argument nodes |
| 86 | netrc | 0.11.0 | **WORKS** | reads, writes and re-reads a .netrc, permission check included |

| 92 | msgpack | 1.8.5 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension, no pure-Ruby fallback |
| 93 | rack-protection | 4.2.1 | **WORKS** | XSS, frame-options, path-traversal, IP-spoofing and origin middleware, each with a request that trips it |
| 94 | rb-fsevent | 0.11.2 | load only | macOS only; inert here, exactly as on Linux CRuby |
| 95 | googleauth | 1.17.4 | load only | every path through it needs Google credentials or the metadata server |
| 96 | unf | 0.2.0 | load only | the pure-Ruby normaliser, because unf_ext is a C++ extension |
| 98 | docile | 1.4.1 | **WORKS** | DSL evaluation against an object, an Array, immutable chaining, block return |
| 99 | simplecov | 1.3.0 | **WORKS** | source files, filters, groups and results over a hand-made coverage map. Measuring real coverage needs `Coverage`, which is a separate question |
| 100 | signet | 0.22.0 | load only | an OAuth2 client; every path through it needs a server |

Named in the brief, further down the list:

| Gem | Version | Status | Evidence / reason |
|-----|---------|--------|-------------------|
| sinatra | 4.2.1 | **WORKS** | routes, params, splats, redirects, custom 404 and 500 handlers, content types. Needed the `Regexp`-is-not-`Enumerable` fix |
| roda | 3.108.0 | **WORKS** | the routing tree, the json and halt plugins, the error handler |
| sqlite3 | IronRuby's own | **WORKS** | DDL, bind parameters (positional, array and named), prepared statements, blobs, transactions, both error classes. The C-extension gem does not install |
| sidekiq | 8.1.7 | **WORKS** | jobs, queues, options, `Sidekiq::Testing` fake/inline/drain |
| webmock | 3.26.4 | **WORKS** | stubbing Net::HTTP by URI, body and headers, regexp matching, `NetConnectNotAllowedError` |
| vcr | 6.4.0 | **WORKS** | replays a hand-written cassette through webmock, and refuses an unrecorded request |
| kramdown | 2.5.2 | **WORKS** | a document with lists, tables, footnotes, definition lists and code blocks, to HTML, LaTeX and back to kramdown. Needed the `[^^]` fix |
| asciidoctor | 2.0.26 | **WORKS** | sections, lists, a table, an admonition, a source block and a cross reference, plus the document model |
| terminal-table | 4.0.0 | **WORKS** | titles, headings, separators, alignment, colspan, non-ASCII cells. Needed the `String#ljust` character-count fix |
| colorize | 1.1.0 | **WORKS** | colours, modes, nesting, `uncolorize`, `disable_colorization` |
| hashie | 5.1.0 | **WORKS** | Mash, Dash, Trash, coercion, deep merge, indifferent access. Needed removing IronRuby's top-level `::Config` |
| dry-inflector | 1.3.1 | **WORKS** | the full inflection set with custom rules, acronyms and uncountables |
| dry-configurable | 1.4.0 | **WORKS** | class and instance settings, nested settings, constructors, `finalize!` |
| tty-prompt | 0.23.1 | **WORKS** | `ask`, `yes?`, `select`, `multi_select` and `mask`, driven through `TTY::Prompt::Test` |
| octokit | 10.0.0 | **WORKS** | repository naming, the URL builders, the error mapping from a response, Sawyer resources |
| sawyer | 0.9.3 | **WORKS** | an agent over Faraday's test adapter: resources, nested resources, hypermedia relations |
| listen | 3.10.0 | **WORKS** | watches a real directory with the polling adapter and sees a file appear |
| chunky_png | 1.4.0 | **WORKS** | draws into an image, encodes it, decodes it again and compares the pixels |
| standard | 1.56.0 | **WORKS** | `Standard::Cli` over a file with a real offence; it is RuboCop underneath |
| yard | 0.9.45 | **BROKEN** | needs Ripper's event-driven parser (`PARSER_EVENT_TABLE` and `on_*` dispatch). IronRuby's Ripper is a prism tree translator with `Ripper.sexp` and the scanner events, not an event parser |
| prawn | 2.5.0 | **BROKEN** | pins `bigdecimal ~> 3.1`; IronRuby's built-in bigdecimal presents as 4.0.1, so RubyGems tries to build the C one and fails. CRuby installs the C gem instead |
| rb-inotify | 0.11.1 | **BROKEN** | needs ffi |
| bcrypt | 3.1.22 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension: the Blowfish KDF. A port, not a shim - `BCrypt.Net` already exists on NuGet |
| oj | 3.17.6 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension. Use `json`, which IronRuby implements |
| google-protobuf | 4.36.2 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension over upb |
| pg | 1.6.3 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension over libpq. Npgsql is the .NET answer and would be a new adapter, not a shim |
| mysql2 | 0.5.7 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C extension over libmysqlclient |
| sassc | 2.4.0 | **IMPOSSIBLE as a gem** | C++ extension over libsass, itself deprecated upstream |

## The 23 top-100 gems not in the popular tier

* Already in the **stdlib tier** of the same catalog, because CRuby ships them:
  `rake` (8), `json` (9), `minitest` (14), `rexml` (39), `racc` (58),
  `base64` (91), `bigdecimal` (97).
* **The tooling doing the installing**: `bundler` (1), `rubygems-update` (75).
  IronRuby's RubyGems is what installed everything in the table.
* **Exercised through the gem that owns them**: `rspec-core` (20),
  `rspec-expectations` (21), `rspec-mocks` (22), `rspec-support` (23) through
  rspec; `mime-types-data` (57) through mime-types; `faraday-net_http` (53)
  through faraday.
* **Rails components with no exercise of their own**: `rails` (45),
  `actionmailer` (50), `actioncable` (80), `activestorage` (88),
  `sprockets-rails` (85). railties boots a whole application and actionpack,
  actionview, activerecord, activejob, globalid and sprockets are each
  exercised; these five are not, so they are not claimed.
* **AWS service gems over aws-sdk-core**: `aws-sdk-s3` (26), `aws-sdk-kms` (28).
* `unf_ext` (89): a C++ extension. `unf` falls back to pure Ruby without it.

## How far down it gets

Of the 77 top-100 gems in the popular tier, **72 work** and 5 do not:
`ffi` (27), `nio4r` (64), `websocket-driver` (70), `puma` (79) and
`msgpack` (92). All five are the same thing - a C extension with no pure-Ruby
path - and the first of them is at **#27**.

Nothing in the top 100 fails any more for a reason that is IronRuby's own. The
ones that did are fixed: Thor, multi_json, Sinatra, RuboCop, terminal-table,
multi_xml, hashie, coderay, kramdown, aws-sdk-core, httpclient, actionview and
nokogiri. What they needed is in the four commits this work produced, and
`ironruby/gem_compat.rb` did not have to grow: every one of them was a bug in
IronRuby, not a gem that needed patching.

## The shims that would unblock the most

1. **ffi** (#27, and rb-inotify, ethon, typhoeus and every gem that binds a
   shared library without writing C). The single biggest lever, and the most
   tractable of the lot: `attach_function` maps onto `NativeLibrary.GetExport`
   plus a delegate built at runtime, and `FFI::Pointer`/`MemoryPointer`/`Struct`
   onto `Marshal.AllocHGlobal` and `Marshal.PtrToStructure`. The work is the
   type table (ffi's type names to CLR marshalling), struct layout including
   bitfields and arrays, callbacks (a Ruby Proc reached from native code is a
   reverse P/Invoke delegate), and `FFI::Library`'s search paths. A week, not a
   month - and most of it is the same machinery Fiddle needs, which is being
   written right now, so the two should share a layer rather than be built
   twice. **Not implemented this round, deliberately.**
2. **nio4r** (#64, and therefore ActionCable, Puma's reactor and anything built
   on a selector). `NIO::Selector` is `Socket.Select` or, better,
   `SocketAsyncEventArgs`; `NIO::Monitor` is a small object around it. Far
   smaller than ffi and entirely doable in C# against `System.Net.Sockets`.
3. **websocket-driver** (#70). Its C extension is *only* the XOR mask loop; the
   protocol is Ruby and the gem is written to run without the `.so`. It simply
   refuses to install when the extension fails to build. Either a tiny C#
   masking method under the same name, or making RubyGems treat a failed
   optional extension as non-fatal, unblocks it.
4. **msgpack** (#92) and **oj**. Both are pure serialisation with no OS surface,
   so both are straightforward C# libraries in the mould of
   `Src/Libraries/Json` - msgpack especially, whose format is a page of spec.
5. **Ripper's event parser**, for YARD. IronRuby already has prism's tree and
   token stream; what is missing is `PARSER_EVENT_TABLE` and the dispatch that
   calls `on_<event>` while walking it. That is Ruby, in
   `Src/StdLib/ironruby/ripper.rb`, and it would serve anything else that
   subclasses `Ripper`.
6. **`Coverage`**, so SimpleCov measures something instead of being exercised on
   a hand-made map. That needs interpreter support, not a shim.

## Things that are not shims

`pg`, `mysql2` and `sassc` are C bindings to libraries the CLR reaches through
entirely different .NET packages (Npgsql, MySqlConnector, LibSassHost). The
honest route is an adapter written against those - which is exactly what
`Src/Libraries/Sqlite3` already is for sqlite3, and why `activerecord` is in the
WORKS column with a real database behind it.

`bcrypt` and `google-protobuf` are ports rather than shims: real algorithms and
real wire formats with good .NET implementations already, so the work is
plumbing a Ruby API onto them.

## Known gaps behind a WORKS

* The Nokogiri shim does not record parse errors for malformed XML, so
  `doc.errors` is empty where libxml2's would not be.
* Nokogiri's SAX events are replayed off the parsed tree rather than streamed,
  so a document has to fit in memory - which is the one thing SAX exists to
  avoid.
* Psych's engine does not keep anchor names, so a `Psych::Nodes::Alias` built
  from a document reports a generated anchor rather than the one in the source.
* `Psych::ClassLoader::Restricted` records its whitelist but does not enforce it
  on the way back out; `Psych.safe_load` is the checked path.
