# Ahead-of-time IronRuby: Ruby -> IL in a saved DLL, and NativeAOT

This is a research prototype. Nothing in the main build or solution depends on `Util/aot`.
The short answers:

- **A. Ruby -> IL in a saved DLL: yes, it works.** `IronRuby.Aot compile` turns a Ruby
  program, and optionally IronRuby's own Ruby-level prelude (`ruby4.rb` and the files it
  requires, about 15k lines), into a .NET assembly. The assembly's methods are the compiled
  Ruby. A stock `dotnet app.dll` runs it with **zero Ruby parser calls**; a tripwire checks this.
- **B. The interpreter under NativeAOT: yes, it works, but only as an interpreter.** A 35-39 MB
  native `ir` runs the prelude and the samples. Getting there needed a DLR patch, trimming
  roots and a host change. Call-site rules can never be compiled to IL, so they are always
  interpreted.
- **C. The two combined: yes, it works.** Ruby -> IL -> ILC produces one native executable
  (`demo-native`, 51 MB). It starts with no parser and no JIT. Method dispatch still goes
  through DLR call sites whose rules are built and interpreted at run time.

All numbers below were taken on a shared 8-core box with a load average of 60-90 from other
agents. Wall times are very noisy. CPU times are a bit better but still inflated. Treat the
numbers as rough.

## A. Ruby -> IL in a saved assembly

### What was known, and what was verified

- `LambdaExpression.CompileToMethod` does not exist on .NET Core. The DLR still has the old
  save-to-disk infrastructure (`SavableScriptCode`, `ToDiskRewriter`, `LegacyScriptCode`), but
  it is compiled out (`FEATURE_LAMBDAEXPRESSION_COMPILETOMETHOD`) because it calls the missing
  API. The DLR's `ILGen` is only an emit helper. **The DLR carries no expression-tree compiler
  of its own.**
- Existing ports:
  - FastExpressionCompiler has `CompileFastToIL(ILGenerator)`. It only handles lambdas without
    closures: its nested lambdas and constants go through its own runtime closure objects.
    IronRuby's blocks are closures, so it does not fit.
  - The .NET Framework compiler in the MIT-licensed Microsoft Reference Source
    (`System.Core/Microsoft/Scripting/Compiler`) still has the MethodBuilder code path. That
    code path is what CompileToMethod used, including nested lambdas as private static
    methods closed over a `Closure` argument. **I ported that one.**

### The tree census (`IronRuby.Aot census file.rb`)

The census does two things:

- It transforms files as `ir` would. It also transforms every `def` body, which IronRuby
  otherwise compiles lazily from the AST at the first call.
- It reduces extension nodes and counts what a saved assembly cannot hold.

| | `samples/demo.rb` | `ruby4.rb` (the prelude) |
|---|---|---|
| expression nodes | 1,822 | 356,678 |
| lambdas / `def` bodies | 9 / 4 | 1,747 / 1,076 |
| dynamic call sites | 27 | 10,827 |
| live-object constants | 57 (14 kinds) | 14,373 (22 kinds) |
| calls to non-public members | 0 | 0 |

The live objects in `ruby4.rb`, and how each is re-created at load time:

| Live object | Count | Re-created as |
|---|---|---|
| `RubyContext` | 2,137 | `AotRuntime.Context` (one runtime per process) |
| `ConstantSiteCache` / `IsDefinedConstantSiteCache` | 2,117 / 20 | `new ...()` |
| `RubyEncoding` | 2,077 | its `IExpressionSerializable`, or a well-known static field |
| `RubySymbol` | 1,914 | `context.CreateSymbol(bytes, encoding)` |
| `WeakReference` | 1,911 | the `ConstantSiteCache.WeakMissingConstant` static field (found by identity) |
| `string[]` (local variable names) | 1,463 | array literal |
| `RubyMethodBody` | 1,076 | see below; this is the hard one |
| `BlockDispatcher*` | 970 | `BlockDispatcher.Create(...)` from its private fields, plus the parameter signature |
| `CallSite<T>` constants | 482 | a static `CallSite<T>` field made with `Create(binder)` |
| `BinaryOpStorage` | 94 | `new BinaryOpStorage(context)` |
| `StrongBox<RubyRegex>` / `StrongBox<MutableString>` (empty caches) | 41 / 28 | `new StrongBox<T>()` |
| `Range` (integer literal) | 39 | `new Range(int, int, bool)` |
| `byte[]` | 4 | array literal |

Every binder is a `RubyMetaBinder` and therefore implements `IExpressionSerializable`. All
of them describe themselves as `X.MakeShared(...)`. The compiler rewrites that to the
runtime-bound `X.Make(context, ...)`, which avoids the cross-runtime checks shared binders
put in their rules.

One call site has more than 16 arguments. Its delegate type is created in an in-memory
assembly. The compiler re-makes it in a tiny saved assembly of its own
(`<name>.Delegate0.dll`) and loads that back.

**This list decides feasibility, and it is short and tractable.** The one real design
problem is `RubyMethodBody`. Two things make it hard:

- A `def` is compiled from the AST at the first call.
- The declaring scope and module are baked into that compilation as constants.

The prototype solves it in three steps:

1. It transforms each body with the scope and module as lambda parameters, producing a
   factory `(RubyScope, RubyModule) => Delegate` that is compiled into the assembly.
2. It keeps only a stub AST at run time: a header with the name, parameters, signature,
   location and `UsesBlock`. `Method#arity`, `#parameters`, dispatch and similar features
   read from that header.
3. It adds a `RubyMethodBody` constructor that takes the factory in place of compiling the
   AST.

### What the compiler does (`IronRuby.Aot compile`)

1. **Parse and transform** with prism, exactly as `ir` does. This also transforms every
   `def` body as described above.
2. **Rewrite** (`AotCompiler.Rewriter`):
   - Every extension node is reduced.
   - Every live constant becomes a static field. The field is initialized **lazily on first
     use** (`field ?? (field = init)`), because eager initialization of the prelude's
     ~19.6k constants cost 2.3-3.4 s before any Ruby ran; lazy initialization brought that
     to 0.8 s.
   - Every `DynamicExpression` becomes `site.Target(site, args)` over a static
     `CallSite<T>` field.
3. **Compile** with the ported LambdaCompiler (`ExpressionCompiler/`, about 10.8k lines) into
   `PersistedAssemblyBuilder` methods. The assembly is saved with an entry point, a
   `runtimeconfig.json` and the IronRuby DLLs, but without prism.
4. **Run** through `AotRuntime.Main`:
   - It sets up the runtime the way `ir` does.
   - It registers the precompiled library files with the loader
     (`Loader.RegisterPrecompiledFile`). `require` still resolves the file on the load path,
     then runs the compiled code instead of parsing the file.
   - It runs the main file.
   - `RubyContext.AlternativeParser` is replaced by a counter. `IR_AOT_FORBID_PARSE=1` makes
     any parse fatal.

Porting notes:

- The Framework compiler used internal members of the expression node classes. These are
  re-expressed over the public API with C# 14 extension members (`Compat.cs`). The
  `StackSpiller` constructors became public factories.
- `Closure` and `RuntimeOps` are not public on .NET Core, so the saved IL references
  `IronRuby.Aot.Runtime.Closure`.
- **.NET 10 bug found:** `ControlFlowBuilder.CopyCodeAndFixupBranches` (System.Reflection.Metadata,
  used by `PersistedAssemblyBuilder` at save time) corrupts the IL when a short branch's
  operand is the last byte of a BlobBuilder chunk. Saving `ruby4.rb` failed with
  `ArgumentOutOfRangeException ('start')`. The workaround is to emit only long branch forms.

Changes to IronRuby itself. All are small and internal; none changes the behaviour of a
normal build.

- `InternalsVisibleTo("IronRuby.Aot")`.
- A `MethodDefinition.TransformBody` overload that takes the scope and module as
  expressions. The old overload now calls it.
- A precompiled-factory constructor on `RubyMethodBody`.
- `Loader.RegisterPrecompiledFile`.
- For part C: in `MethodDispatcher`, a check that applies only when dynamic code is
  unsupported (see below).

### Reproduce

```sh
dotnet build Util/aot/IronRuby.Aot -c Release -p:DlrSourceDir=/root/workspace/dlr/src/core
A=Util/aot/IronRuby.Aot/bin/Release/net10.0/IronRuby.Aot
$A census Util/aot/samples/demo.rb Src/StdLib/ironruby/ruby4.rb
$A selftest /tmp/st                                   # the ported compiler alone: closures, try/catch, switch
$A compile --prelude -o /tmp/demo Util/aot/samples/demo.rb
IR_AOT_TRACE=1 IR_AOT_FORBID_PARSE=1 dotnet /tmp/demo/demo.dll   # "parser calls: 0"
Util/aot/build-samples.sh /tmp/ironruby-aot            # hello/demo/bench x {noprelude, prelude, r2r}
python3 Util/aot/measure.py -n 5 'a=cmd' 'b=cmd'       # best-of-N wall and CPU
```

`--r2r` runs crossgen2 (ReadyToRun) over the saved assembly and over IronRuby's assemblies.
`--eager-init` switches back to initializing all constants at load time.

### Results

All five samples produce the same output as `./ir.sh`:

- `demo.rb`: fib, a class with state, blocks, string interpolation, an exception.
- `errors.rb`: backtraces and an uncaught error, including the exit code.
- `hello.rb`, `bench.rb`, `loop.rb`.

Backtrace frame labels (`Widget#explode`, `block in ...`, `<main>`) are correct. Paths are
absolute, where `ir` prints them relative.

Output sizes:

| Build | `.dll` size |
|---|---|
| `demo.rb` alone | 21 KB |
| with the prelude (lazy initialization) | 4.3 MB |
| with the prelude, ReadyToRun | 13.3 MB |

Compiling with the prelude takes 15-21 s. It produces about 19.6k constant fields, 12,328
call sites and 1,273 `def` bodies compiled ahead of time.

**Startup, `hello.rb`, best of 5 (load average ~90):**

| | wall | CPU |
|---|---|---|
| `./ir.sh` Release net10.0 | 9.60 s | 4.02 s |
| `./ir.sh` ReadyToRun (`Util/publish-r2r.sh`) | 6.60 s | 2.92 s |
| AOT dll + prelude | 7.30 s | 3.07 s |
| AOT dll + prelude + `--r2r` | **3.75 s** | **1.50 s** |

The `noprelude` row is not a fair comparison and is left out. It ran in 1.20 s wall /
0.44 s CPU, but without `ruby4.rb` there is no `Array#sum`, so `hello.rb` failed.

Where the time goes (single `IR_AOT_TRACE` runs, so unsure):

- **Without R2R:** 4,574 methods were JIT-compiled, taking 4.0 s of JIT time.
- **With `--r2r`:** the runtime was ready in 0.29 s, and the `ruby4.rb` top level took
  1.47 s. 908 methods were still JIT-compiled (0.7 s). In another run, 376 of the 961
  JIT-compiled methods were `CallSite.Target` rule delegates, which the DLR compiles at run
  time.

**The IL is there. Startup is now bounded by run-time rule creation, not by parsing.**

**Steady state, `bench.rb`, best round of 5, in ms. UNSURE: runs varied up to 3x between
repeats under this load:**

| | fib(25) | vectors | strings |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRuby 4.0.6 | 26 | 383 | 143 |
| `ir` default (`-X:JIT`/`-X:OSR` on) | 2.3 | 804 | 588 |
| `ir -X:NoJIT -X:NoOSR` | 203 | 1,291 | 368 |
| AOT dll (3 runs) | 199-248 | 681-1,071 | 338-1,291 |

The AOT dll is roughly on par with `ir` without its method JIT. **It cannot use `-X:JIT`:**
that JIT specializes from the `def`'s AST body, which the saved assembly does not have. So
`fib` is about 100x slower than `ir`'s default.

## B. The interpreter under NativeAOT

To build and run it (the DLR patch is applied to a private copy; the shared checkout is not
touched):

```sh
Util/aot/NativeAot/make-dlr-copy.sh /tmp/dlr-aot
dotnet publish Util/aot/NativeAot/ir-native.csproj -c Release -p:DlrSourceDir=/tmp/dlr-aot/src/core
Util/aot/NativeAot/ir-native.sh -X:NoJIT -X:NoOSR --disable-gems Util/aot/samples/demo.rb
```

`ir-native.csproj` builds the same host with `PublishAot`, rooting IronRuby, the DLR and
prism. With `-p:PublishAot=false` it builds a JIT binary that takes the same no-dynamic-code
paths, which is useful for debugging. `IR_FIRST_CHANCE=N` prints the first N distinct
exceptions; that is how the walls below were found.

The publish produces 292 IL3050 warnings (`RequiresDynamicCode`) plus about 330 trimming
warnings.

**Walls, in the order they were hit:**

1. **`System.Configuration`.** `ScriptRuntimeSetup.ReadConfiguration` fails under AOT. Fix:
   the host builds its `ScriptRuntimeSetup` directly.
2. **UTF-7 disabled.** A `RuntimeHostConfigurationOption` does not override the SDK's baked-in
   feature switch. Fix: `<EnableUnsafeUTF7Encoding>true</EnableUnsafeUTF7Encoding>`.
3. **`LightLambda.MakeRun5<...>` has no native code.** `MakeGenericMethod` over value types
   fails under AOT. This is the IL3050 wall that sits on every call site. It is fixed by
   `Build/dlr-patches/aot/0001-interpreter-only-without-dynamic-code.patch`. When
   `RuntimeFeature.IsDynamicCodeSupported` is false, the patch changes three things:
   - `LightLambda` falls back to an `object[]` thunk for delegate types that have no native
     instantiation. System.Linq.Expressions interprets the thunk.
   - Lambda and loop compilation thresholds are set to infinity. Compiling there only hands
     the code to System.Linq.Expressions' own interpreter, which is slower.
   - `CallInstruction` uses reflection invoke for signatures that contain value types,
     instead of trying the generic `FuncCallInstruction<...>` and catching the failure.

   In short, **call-site rules (the binders' output) are always interpreted.** This answers
   the question in the brief: there is a fallback, and it is the DLR's own interpreter.
4. **CLR interop hits the trimmer.** `ruby4.rb` calls `System::Type.get_type`, `System::Math`,
   `System::GC` and similar APIs through reflection, and IronRuby's binders look up
   conversion operators and members by name. Fix: `NativeAot/roots.xml` lists the needed
   types one by one.

   Rooting `System.Private.CoreLib` whole does not link (`undefined reference to
   RhIsGCBridgeActive`). So **any Ruby program that uses other .NET types through interop
   needs them rooted by hand.** This is inherent to trimming.
5. **Prelude load took minutes, then segfaulted.**
   - Every missing generic instantiation surfaced as a caught exception
     (`MissingTemplateException`, "missing native code").
   - Under that load, backtrace handling looped
     (`Exception#set_backtrace` -> `Location.__parse__` -> `MatchData#[]`).
   - `hello.rb` took 562 s wall and then segfaulted. The segfault was not investigated
     further; it went away with the wall 3 and 4 fixes.

**Results with all fixes (single runs, UNSURE):**

- The native binary is 35-39 MB. `demo.rb` and `errors.rb` produce the right output, and so
  does `hello.rb` with the full prelude.
- Backtraces contain extra `:0:in 'Throw'` / `'Run'` frames. This is cosmetic.
- `loop.rb`, in ms:

  | | while loop, 1M iterations | 200k calls |
  |---|---|---|
  | native | 1,430 | 482 |
  | `ir -X:NoJIT -X:NoOSR` | 311 | 380 |
  | `ir` default | 155 | 665 |
  | CRuby | 67 | 42 |

  Before the threshold patch the loop took 3.1-6.0 s.
- **The native `ir`'s startup time was not measured.**
- The JIT build without dynamic code ran `hello.rb` with `--disable-gems` in 3.25 s wall /
  2.77 s CPU. That was measured before the `CallInstruction` fix.

## C. Ruby -> IL -> one native executable

```sh
Util/aot/NativeProgram/build.sh Util/aot/samples/demo.rb /tmp/w   # -> /tmp/w/demo-native/demo-native
IR_AOT_TRACE=1 IR_AOT_FORBID_PARSE=1 /tmp/w/demo-native/demo-native
```

How the build works:

1. `IronRuby.Aot compile --prelude` produces the IL.
2. ILC compiles that assembly (rooted, reached through `RubyProgram.Main`) together with
   IronRuby, built against the patched DLR copy.

The result for `demo.rb` is 51 MB. It gives the right output with **0 parser calls and 0
JIT-compiled methods**:

| Step | Time (one run, UNSURE) |
|---|---|
| runtime ready | 37 ms |
| `ruby4.rb` top level | 663-867 ms |
| total | about 1.0 s |

**What stays dynamic.** Every Ruby method call, operator and conversion still goes through
a `CallSite<T>`. Its rules are built by IronRuby's binders at run time and, without a JIT,
interpreted. Pre-binding the monomorphic common case is plausible, but it is not built. It
would mean emitting a guarded direct call in the saved IL: check the receiver's class
version, then call the compiled `def` factory's delegate.
`RubyModule.GlobalMethodVersion` (see `-X:JIT`) already gives a sound one-integer guard.

**The value-type dispatcher limitation.** IronRuby's precompiled rule dispatchers
(`RubyObjectMethodDispatcher*<T1..Tn>`) are built with `MakeGenericType` over the call
site's argument types. Under NativeAOT the instantiations over value types (e.g. `<int>` in
`fib(n - 1)`) do not exist. Commit 469a95a4 makes `MethodDispatcher.CreateDispatcher` return
null in that case when dynamic code is unsupported. The binder then builds an ordinary
(interpreted) rule. Calls with `int` arguments therefore lose the fast dispatcher. Normal
builds are unaffected, because the check is behind `!IsDynamicCodeSupported`.

## Limits and next steps (rough effort)

- **Next: ReadyToRun follow-up.** `--r2r` exists and is measured above (3.75 s / 1.50 s CPU
  vs 6.60 s / 2.92 s for R2R `ir`).
  - I had started an `--inputbubble` crossgen2 build (all assemblies in one version bubble),
    to cut the remaining ~900 JIT-compiled methods. It ran once without being measured.
  - Worth doing with care on an idle box, together with a proper startup comparison against
    the native binaries. About 1 day.
- **Method JIT for AOT bodies.** Serialize enough of the `def` AST, or run the method JIT's
  specialization at compile time and emit the specialized body with its guard. 1-2 weeks.
  This would close the 100x `fib` gap.
- **Pre-bound call sites** (the monomorphic guard + direct call described in C). About 1-2
  weeks for Ruby-to-Ruby calls. It removes most run-time rule creation, which is the startup
  and NativeAOT bottleneck.
- **Correctness breadth.** Only 5 samples plus the prelude were run.
  - Not run: specs, `eval`/`binding` in compiled code, `define_method`, refinements,
    coverage, TracePoint (compiled with `SavePath` set, which turns off OSR and coverage).
  - Frame labels come from lexical nesting and may be wrong for methods defined through
    `class_eval` and similar.
  - Lazy constant initialization races benignly: two threads may create two `RubyMethodBody`
    objects for one `def` at first use.
  - `RuntimeVariablesExpression` and `Quote` are not supported by the port.
  - Standard-library files that are not compiled in are still parsed at run time; the
    tripwire counts them.

  Several weeks to run the spec suite through the AOT path.
- **NativeAOT interop** needs a per-program list of rooted .NET types. A compile-time scan of
  `::System::X` constants in the Ruby would get most of it. About 2-3 days.
- **Upstreaming.**
  - The DLR patch is small and safe: it only acts when dynamic code is unsupported.
  - The `PersistedAssemblyBuilder` short-branch bug is worth reporting to dotnet/runtime.

`Build/dlr-patches/aot/` is deliberately a subdirectory, so CI's `Build/dlr-patches/*.patch`
glob does not apply it to normal builds.
