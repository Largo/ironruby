# Publish a ReadyToRun (AOT-precompiled) build of the console host.

#   IR_CONFIG=R2R ./ir.sh -e ''    # run it
#
# Why: almost half of IronRuby's remaining startup time is the .NET JIT
# compiling IronRuby's own interpreter, binder and parser paths - the same
# methods, from scratch, in every process.  crossgen2 compiles them ahead of
# time into the assemblies, so a fresh process starts from native code and only
# re-JITs what tiering decides is hot.  Measured on an idle box, `./ir.sh -e ''`,
# best of 4:
#
#   Release, dotnet build      1.37 s     Release --disable-gems      1.15 s
#   Release, this script       0.93 s     Release --disable-gems      0.74 s
#
# It is a separate output tree rather than the default because ReadyToRun only
# runs in the `dotnet publish` pipeline, needs a RuntimeIdentifier, and takes
# noticeably longer to build than `dotnet build` - not something every worktree
# and every agent script should pay on each rebuild.  The IL is the same, so the
# published host passes the same specs as the Release build it came from.
#
# The output lands in Src/Console/bin/R2R/$IR_TFM, which is exactly where
# IR_CONFIG=R2R makes ir.sh look; no change to ir.sh is needed.
