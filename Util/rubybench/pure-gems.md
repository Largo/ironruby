# ruby-bench: the pure-Ruby gem macro benchmarks

Status of the macro benchmarks in [ruby-bench](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-bench)
that exercise a pure-Ruby gem, under IronRuby.  Reproduce with
`Util/rubybench/pure-gems-run.sh <your ruby-bench copy>`; the numbers below were
taken with `WARMUP_ITRS=1 MIN_BENCH_ITRS=3`, IronRuby in Release on .NET 8, and
CRuby 4.0.6 as the oracle for both timing and output.  Per-iteration times, as
the harness reports them ("Average of last 3, non-warmup iters").

| Benchmark | Status | IronRuby | CRuby 4.0.6 | Ratio |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| erubi | OK | 1192 ms | 332 ms | 3.6x |
| etanni | OK | 1511 ms | 581 ms | 2.6x |
| chunky-png | OK | 2284 ms | 1141 ms | 2.0x |
| liquid-render | OK | 1807 ms | 225 ms | 8.0x |
| liquid-compile | OK | 498 ms | 94 ms | 5.3x |
| liquid-il | OK | 2710 ms | 449 ms | 6.0x |
| liquid-c | N/A | | | needs the liquid-c C extension (liquid_c.so); no CRuby ABI here, so it cannot be built or loaded |
| psych-load | OK | 6036 ms | 2684 ms | 2.2x |
| addressable-parse | OK | 1864 ms | 702 ms | 2.7x |
| addressable-equality | OK | 5825 ms | 1963 ms | 3.0x |
| addressable-getters | OK | 842 ms | 202 ms | 4.2x |
| addressable-join | OK | 1985 ms | 1038 ms | 1.9x |
| addressable-merge | OK | 984 ms | 215 ms | 4.6x |
| addressable-new | OK | 648 ms | 109 ms | 5.9x |
| addressable-normalize | OK | 2572 ms | 650 ms | 4.0x |
| addressable-setters | OK | 1123 ms | 203 ms | 5.5x |
| addressable-to-s | OK | 896 ms | 241 ms | 3.7x |
| tinygql | OK | 180677 ms | 1496 ms | 120.8x |
| protoboeuf | OK | 59598 ms | 237 ms | 251x |
| protoboeuf-encode | OK | 5667 ms | 277 ms | 20.5x |
| json_parse_float | N/A | | | ractor-only benchmark (`ractor_only: true`): it needs harness-ractor, which needs Ractor. Under the default harness it fails the same way on CRuby (`undefined method 'zero?' for nil`) |
| json_parse_string | N/A | | | same - ractor-only |
| hexapdf | OK | 46989 ms | 4163 ms | 11.3x |
| rubykon | OK | 5867 ms | 1802 ms | 3.3x |
| rubyboy | OK | 79154 ms | 6596 ms | 12.0x |
| optcarrot | OK | 82016 ms | 9343 ms | 8.8x |
| graphql | OK | 20528 ms | 85 ms | 241x |
| graphql-native | N/A | | | needs graphql-c_parser's graphql/graphql_c_parser_ext.so |

Every one of the 24 that run had to be fixed to get there - before this round the
harness killed all of them (see bug 1) and half could not even `bundle install`.

## Output equivalence

A benchmark that runs but computes the wrong thing is worse than one that fails,
so every benchmark whose result is a byte string was compared against CRuby
rather than just timed.  All of these agree exactly:

| Benchmark | What was compared |
|---|---|
| chunky-png | SHA-256 of all nine `to_blob` encodings, the RGBA and RGB streams, and a decode round-trip - identical, zlib levels included |
| protoboeuf, protoboeuf-encode | the 11 decoded messages re-encoded with `to_proto`: 4648275 bytes, same SHA-256 |
| optcarrot | the PPU pixel buffer after 20, 60 and 200 frames (`output_pixels.pack("C*")`), same sum and SHA-256 |
| rubyboy | the PPU frame buffer after 50, 200 and 500 steps (`@buffer.pack("V*")`), same SHA-256 |
| liquid-render | the rendered output of all compiled theme tests: 165689 bytes, identical |
| psych-load | the loaded structure of each of the three YAML fixtures (found a bug, see below) |
| graphql | `GraphQL.parse(negotiate.gql).to_query_string`: 81246 bytes, same SHA-256 (found a bug, see below) |
| tinygql | the full token stream of negotiate.gql: 5262 tokens, same SHA-256 |
| hexapdf | the benchmark checks the PDF size itself (569797 bytes) - it now passes (found a bug, see below) |
| erubi | the benchmark checks the generated source size and the rendered size itself - both pass |

## Bugs found and fixed

Seven IronRuby bugs, all committed on this branch.

1. **Fiddle::Function did not exist** - `require "fiddle"` succeeded and defined
   only `Fiddle::Handle`, so anything reaching for `Fiddle::Function` died with a
   NameError rather than a LoadError it could rescue.  ruby-bench's harness calls
   `getrusage(2)` through it to report maxrss, so *every* macro benchmark raised
   after its last iteration and never wrote its result.  Now implemented on a
   `calli` stub emitted per native signature (the technique the 32-bit-only
   Win32API library already used), with `Fiddle::Pointer`,
   `Fiddle.malloc/realloc/free` and the size_t / const-string / bool typedefs on
   top.  `Fiddle::Closure` (native -> Ruby callbacks) is still missing.

2. **A Gemfile that pins a C-extension gem could not be installed** - three
   separate causes, all fixed in `rubygems/defaults/ironruby.rb`:
   `Gem::Installer#build_extensions` still ran `extconf.rb` and aborted the
   bundle; a host CRuby's installed copy of a library IronRuby provides itself
   shadowed the default gem (worst case: `BUNDLED WITH 4.0.12` made
   `Bundler::SelfManager` switch to an upstream Bundler without IronRuby's
   carve-outs, which then dropped every extension gem from its index); and such a
   gem could still put its lib directory on `$LOAD_PATH` through Bundler, where
   bigdecimal's one-line `lib/bigdecimal.rb` requires `bigdecimal.so`.  Also
   `Bundler::SelfManager` no longer switches away from the bundled Bundler at
   all.  This is what unblocked liquid-render, liquid-compile, liquid-il,
   psych-load and the json benchmarks' `bundle install`.

3. **A keyword-arguments hash stayed "keywords" forever** - `f(a: 1)` builds a
   Hash marked as this call's keyword arguments, and the mark was never removed.
   A method that declares no keyword parameters gets that hash as an ordinary
   positional argument and may keep it, and then any later call that passed it on
   to a method that *does* take keywords failed with `wrong number of arguments
   (given 0, expected 1)`:

   ```ruby
   def set_filter(f, parms = nil) = parms
   h = set_filter(:x, Columns: 5, Predictor: 12)
   def wrap(obj, type: nil) = [obj, type]
   wrap(h, type: 1)     # ArgumentError; CRuby returns [{Columns: 5, ...}, 1]
   ```

   That is HexaPDF's `Stream#set_filter`, and it stopped hexapdf writing a PDF.

4. **`Object#type` still existed** - the 1.8 spelling of `#class`, removed in
   1.9.  Defining it is not harmless: `obj.respond_to?(:type)` is a live test in
   real code.  HexaPDF's `TextLayouter#fit` uses it to tell already-segmented
   text items from raw ones, so with a `Kernel#type` in the way it skipped
   segmentation and laid out nothing - a 618 byte PDF instead of 569797, with no
   error anywhere.

5. **A folded YAML scalar could not carry a chomping or indentation indicator** -
   the scanner opened a block scalar only when the character after `>` was
   whitespace, so `>-`, `>+` and `>2` scanned as plain scalars and the header
   text ended up in the value (`"​>- one two"`).  Three strings in
   psych-load's `discourse_client.en.yaml` loaded wrong.

6. **`JSON.generate` took no options argument** - the documented signature is
   `generate(obj, opts)`.  graphql's printer ends every value in
   `JSON.generate(value, quirks_mode: true)`, so `to_query_string` could not run
   at all.  indent / space / space_before / object_nl / array_nl / max_nesting
   are honoured now, anything else ignored, as the json gem does.

7. **Bundler switched away from the Bundler IronRuby ships** - counted with 2
   above, but a separate commit: `Bundler::SelfManager#find_restart_version` now
   returns early here, so a `BUNDLED WITH` line naming another version cannot
   replace the patched copy in Src/StdLib with an upstream release.

## Known slow paths (not fixed here)

`StringScanner` is O(n) per scan operation, so scanning a large string is
quadratic: `StringScanner#skip` with a Regexp goes through
`StringScanner.RestString()`, which copies the remaining bytes into a fresh
binary MutableString and then decodes all of them to a .NET string for the match.
`_fixedAnchor` mode is no better - `CharIndexOf` slices and counts characters from
the start of the string on every call.

Lexing ruby-bench's 81 KB `negotiate.gql` with tinygql's StringScanner-based
lexer - about 15000 scan operations - takes **1.29 s** on IronRuby against
**0.003 s** on CRuby, a factor of 430.  That is essentially all of tinygql's 121x
and graphql's 241x, the two worst ratios in the table, and everything in the
standard library that scans with StringScanner (csv, erb, rdoc, prism's
`scan_byte` polyfill) pays the same.  Fixing it means matching against the whole
string at an offset - .NET's `Regex.Match(input, beginning, length)` has exactly
StringScanner's non-fixed-anchor anchoring semantics, where `\A` and `^` anchor
at the scan pointer - plus a byte-index/char-index fast path for ASCII-only and
single-byte strings so `CharIndexOf` stops being O(n) too.  Left alone here
because it is a change in a hot shared path rather than a correctness fix.

protoboeuf's 251x is a different shape: its generated decoder is a byte-at-a-time
varint loop (`getbyte`, `<<`, `&`, `|`) with no library call to blame, so it is a
straight read on how fast IronRuby runs small-integer arithmetic in a tight Ruby
loop.  protoboeuf-*encode*, which does the same kind of work but builds strings,
is 20x - the gap between the two is worth a look on its own.
